			   Ecolab has been using Serena's products for 12 years and I have attended nine User Conferences during this time frame.
			   Serena's User Conference in '06 exceeded my expectations with the amount of technical content delivered, and the one-on-one sessions available with the technical support staff.
			   It gave me the opportunity to discuss technical issues in a one-on-one environment.
			   In addition, presentations which demonstrated the interface capabilities clearly showed all the various activities which can be managed within the Application Lifecycle Framework––excellent opportunity to understand and SEE the big picture.
			    Outstanding job this year SERENA!!!<br/>

			   I attended my first xChange this year in Las Vegas. The event was awesome!
			   The Serena team put together a very well organized and well thought out series of events that were fun and very informational.
			   I was pleasantly surprised by the technical talent that Serena brought to xChange and how easily accessible they were.
			   I will definitely attend future xChange events. I will definitely attend future xChange events.<br/>

			   As a first-time attendee of the Serena xChange 2006, I was blown away with what I saw and experienced.
			   From a first-class presentation to available personnel, including the president to customer/technical support, Serena was first class.
			   As a new TeamTrack customer, I was especially impressed with the interaction I experienced with technical support and the availability of having dedicated time slots to meet with them to specifically discuss any problems that I had.
			   We (Serena Users) even had a voice in stating what we&rsquo;d like to see as our future enhancements.
			   Everyone from Serena was available and LISTENING. For once, I felt special as a customer should feel.
			   It was great to meet other users of TeamTrack, too, as they had invaluable information and tips to share.
			   It is a must for any Serena customer to attend. You'll have a blast.<br/>
